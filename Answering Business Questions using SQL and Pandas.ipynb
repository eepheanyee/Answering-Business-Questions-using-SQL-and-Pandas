I can do this by getting the list of tracks from an invoice and comparing it to the list of tracks from an album. I can find the album to compare the purchase to by looking up the album that one of the purchased tracks belongs to. It doesn't matter which track I pick, since if it's an album purchase, that album will be the same for all tracks.\n"
